Hey! It's Jawn D. here! This is a little thing I have been working on, mostly for my own benifit. I go to a school that blocks a lot of stuff, so instead of relying on other people to make new links, and me having to search for them, I decided to fork the original project and modify it, and make my own link. I spent a mere couple hours to modify this for my own website, so I would like to appreciate the people who actually put in the work. I wanted to give a big thanks to player-k12 and radmanplays for the amazing work they have done making this amazing place where we can play all the different versions of eagler out there. And lets not forget lax1dude, wherever he is now, for creating eaglercraft, Alexey Andreev for making teavm, the program that is the reason that eaglercraft works, Brendan Eich for creating javascript, also thanks to Ioannis Tsakpinis, the creator of LWJGL, Mojang, Notch, Jeb, Microsoft?, for their work on minecraft itself, ayunami2000 for working with the other aspects of eaglercraft, me for doing nothing, I would also like to thank the interne-
